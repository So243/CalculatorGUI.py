# Simple Calculator GUI

This Python program utilizes the Tkinter library to create a basic GUI calculator. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Users can input numerical values and perform calculations by pressing corresponding buttons. The GUI provides a clear interface for users to interact with and obtain results.

## How to Use

1. **Input Numbers:** Click on the numerical buttons (0-9) to input numbers.
2. **Perform Operations:**
   - Addition: Click on the '+' button.
   - Subtraction: Click on the '-' button.
   - Multiplication: Click on the '*' button.
   - Division: Click on the '/' button.
3. **Decimal Point:** Use the '.' button to input decimal points.
4. **Clear:** Click on the 'Clear' button to reset the input.
5. **Equals:** Click on the '=' button to evaluate the expression.
6. **Error Handling:** If an error occurs (e.g., division by zero), "error" will be displayed.

## Implementation Details

- The program defines functions to handle button presses, evaluate expressions, and clear the input.
- Exception handling is implemented to catch errors during expression evaluation.
- The Tkinter library is used to create the graphical user interface, including buttons and an entry field for displaying the expression.
- The program has a light green background to enhance readability.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `calculator.py`).
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
4. The GUI calculator window will appear, allowing you to perform calculations.

## Dependencies

The program does not have any external dependencies. It utilizes the standard Tkinter library, which is included in most Python installations.
